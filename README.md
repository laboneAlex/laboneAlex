- 👋 Hi, I’m @laboneAlex
- 👀 I’m interested in acquiring machine learning skills primarily for application in accounts receivable - credit collections and dispute management as well as incoming payments. I am also interested in distributed ledger technology (blockchain) especially smart contracts and their interface to traditional ERP systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "machine learning"
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on general projects for gaining a solid foundation in machine learning, applying ml techniques to accounts receivable
